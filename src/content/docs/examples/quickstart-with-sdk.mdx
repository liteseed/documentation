title: Post signed data to Arweave using @liteseed/sdk
description: This example demonstrates posting a data-item using @liteseed/sdk
---

In this tutorial, we will walkthrough the process of uploading data to Arweave using the [`@liteseed/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liteseed/sdk).

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside title="Note.">
This guide is in TypeScript.

<Aside type="caution" title="4GB File Size Limit!">
    The LiteSeed API is currently in beta so file upload size limit is set to 4GB.

## Installing the required packages

This tutorial requires the installation of the `@liteseed/sdk`.

```shell
npm install @liteseed/sdk
```

[`@liteseed/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liteseed/sdk) is the official js library for interacting with the Liteseed for js/ts.

## Uploading Data

The sdk makes it very easy to upload data.

### Initializing the SDK

First, you must create a new instance of Liteseed with the private key (JWK) you will use to sign and upload the data.

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { Liteseed } from "@liteseed/sdk";

const jwk = JSON.parse(readFileSync("./arweave.json").toString());
const liteseed = new Liteseed(jwk);
```

### Signing the data

You can convert any data into a special arweave transaction using `signData`.

```ts
 const data = readFileSync("image.jpeg");
 const dataItem = await liteseed.signData({ data });
```

:::note[The ID returned is compatible with any Gateway]
The id returned by API is the Arweave data-item id. You can fetch this data from any [gateway](http://ar.io/).
:::

*Store the id* in a database, so you can query your data later easily.

### Posting the signed data

Next, you must pay for the upload to complete the process. You can check for the price of upload as follows.

```js
  const receipt = await liteseed.postSignedData({ dataItem });
  console.log(receipt);
```

The receipt object looks something like the following
The response would look something like this
```json
{
  "id": "kscLYZ3UHdCUZAimSr6wrSl5v-ll8uOQr_G8ZQ4osYA",
  "dataCaches": ["api.liteseed.xyz"],
  "fastFinalityIndexes": ["api.liteseed.xyz"],
  "deadlineHeight": 1470374,
  "owner": "...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Make the payment

Finally, you need to simply make the payment.

```ts
  const payment = await liteseed.sendPayment({ dataItem });
  console.log(payment);
```

:::note[What if my payment fails?]
Data is held for approximately 100 Blocks from the initial post of data.
:::

# The Complete Example

Here's the complete code for uploading a data-item using the `@liteseed/sdk`.

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { Liteseed } from "@liteseed/sdk";

const jwk = JSON.parse(readFileSync("./arweave.json").toString());
const liteseed = new Liteseed(jwk);
const data = readFileSync("image.jpeg");

async function upload(data) {
  const dataItem = await liteseed.signData({ data });
  const receipt = await liteseed.postSignedData({ dataItem });
  console.log(receipt);
  const payment = await liteseed.sendPayment({ dataItem });
  console.log(payment);
}

upload(data);
```
