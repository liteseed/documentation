Arweave is a blockchain for data storage. For a fee, you can make some data permanent.

# Why permanent storage?

Permanent storage has many applications including storage for a lot of humanities most important data.

## A solution to link rot
Link rot is the phenomenon where URLs stop working over time.
The rate of link rot is still debated however it's important as it quantifies internet's ability to preserve information. 
Estimates of that rate vary dramatically between studies. 
Link rot could make important archival data disappear, potentially impacting the legal system and scholarship.

## Storing private data
Apps like [Ardrive](https://ardrive.io/) and [Akord](https://akord.com/) offer services that allow permanent storage of private data.
Things like important documents and photos can easily be stored on these platforms.

## Archiving code repositories
[Protocol.Land](https://protocol.land/) offers the ability to archive important code repositories.
This is especially useful in cases where projects are dependent on critical libraries whose history needs to be vetted.

# Who is storing my data?
The protocol is secured by a network of miners, who store and replicate data for a reward of
AR token.

# How are rewards calculated?

Transactions are priced using two components
1. A highly conservative estimate of perpetual storage. These rewards are funded by a storage endowment model which are distributed over a period of time. 
At a high level, this endowment mechanism quantifies the cost of permanent storage as a function of decreasing hard drive costs. 
Looking at historic price decreases per GB of storage, it calculates a transaction price for storage of data. 
In order for miners to store data, transaction cost should simply remain greater than cost of storage.

2. An instantly released transaction reward to incentivize miners to accept new transactions
