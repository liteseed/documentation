title: Liteseed vs Backblaze B2
description: Comparing Liteseed Network and Backblaze B2 for long-term and cold storage
---

## Overview

Both Liteseed Network and Backblaze B2 (including their low-cost archival tier) offer affordable, durable storage—but they differ in pricing model, retrieval, decentralization, and lock-in.

| Feature                | Liteseed Network                           | Backblaze B2                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Pricing Model**      | One-time, up-front fee for permanent storage on Arweave | Pay-as-you-go monthly storage ($0.005/GB-month), plus egress and request fees |
| **Retrieval Cost**     | No extra fees; data served via any gateway | $0.01/GB for downloads; free first 1 GB each day |
| **Retrieval Speed**    | Instant via global Arweave gateways        | Instant via HTTP/S3-compatible API         |
| **Durability**         | Decentralized replication across many nodes, immutable once committed | 11 nines durability across Backblaze’s data centers |
| **Decentralization**   | Censorship-resistant, open-standard bundles on Arweave | Centralized under Backblaze’s infrastructure |
| **Vendor Lock-In**     | Open standards (ANS-104), any gateway can serve your data | Proprietary B2 API, egress charges apply when migrating |
| **Use Cases**          | Legal archives, scientific datasets, digital art, NFTs—data that must remain unchanged forever | General backups, media archives, bulk-storage for application data |

## In Depth

### 1. Pricing Model

- **Liteseed**  
  Pay once to commit data permanently. No ongoing bills, no hidden renewal fees.  
- **Backblaze B2**  
  $0.005 per GB per month. You pay each month for stored data plus $0.01 per GB for downloads and $0.004 per 10,000 API calls.

### 2. Retrieval

- **Liteseed**  
  Fetch data via any Arweave gateway with standard HTTP requests. No retrieval tiering or extra charges.  
- **Backblaze B2**  
  Immediate downloads via HTTP or S3 API. Fees apply per GB retrieved, with a small free daily allowance.

### 3. Durability & Redundancy

- **Liteseed**  
  Data is bundled and anchored on Arweave’s decentralized network. Copies exist on every participating node, ensuring immutability and censorship resistance.  
- **Backblaze B2**  
  Data is stored redundantly across multiple AWS-equivalent data centers, offering high durability but within a single vendor’s domain.

### 4. Vendor Neutrality

- **Liteseed**  
  Uses open “data-item” and bundle standards. You hold your own keys and metadata, and any gateway (e.g. `arweave.net`) can serve your files.  
- **Backblaze B2**  
  Uses a proprietary API. You can access data via S3-compatible endpoints, but transferring large archives out incurs egress fees.

### 5. Ideal Use Cases

- **Choose Liteseed when you need**  
  - True permanent archival with no ongoing cost  
  - Censorship-resistant or immutable storage  
  - Open-standard bundles and full control of keys  
- **Choose Backblaze B2 when you need**  
  - Flexible, low-cost cloud storage with predictable monthly billing  
  - Frequent or unpredictable retrieval patterns  
  - Integration with existing S3-compatible tools
