title: Liteseed vs. S3 Glacier
description: Why choose Liteseed Network over Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term archival
---

## Overview

Both Liteseed Network and Amazon S3 Glacier solve the same problem: cold, long-term data archival. Here’s how they compare and why Liteseed can be a compelling alternative.

### Pay-Once vs. Recurring Fees

- **Liteseed**  
  - One-time, up-front fee locks in permanent storage on Arweave  
  - No future renewals, no surprise billing  
- **S3 Glacier**  
  - Recurring monthly storage and retrieval fees  
  - Costs can rise over time as your archive grows

### Retrieval Speed & Predictability

- **Liteseed**  
  - Data served instantly via global Arweave gateways  
  - No cold retrieval tiers or extra “expedited retrieval” charges  
- **S3 Glacier**  
  - Multiple retrieval tiers (standard, bulk, expedited) with variable latency  
  - Higher fees for faster access

### Durability & Decentralization

- **Liteseed**  
  - Decentralized network of bundlers and miners secures your archive  
  - Censorship-resistant and immutable once committed  
- **S3 Glacier**  
  - Stored within AWS’s regional infrastructure  
  - High durability guarantees (11 9s), but still under centralized control

### Vendor Neutrality & Lock-In

- **Liteseed**  
  - Open standards (ANS-104 bundles on Arweave)  
  - You retain your own keys and metadata; data can be fetched from any Arweave gateway  
- **S3 Glacier**  
  - Proprietary AWS API and pricing model  
  - Migration out of Glacier often incurs data transfer and early-termination fees

### Use Cases

- **Liteseed** is ideal for:  
  - Regulatory archives (legal, financial, healthcare)  
  - Scientific or cultural datasets that must remain unaltered forever  
  - Digital art, NFTs, academic publications  
- **S3 Glacier** is ideal for:  
  - Large-scale logs and backups with predictable monthly budgets  
  - Workloads that require occasional batch retrievals
