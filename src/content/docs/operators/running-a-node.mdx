The node is run using a CLI tool called edge.
The latest release of the latest version of the CLI tool is available on [Github](https://github.com/liteseed/edge/releases)

# Running the latest version of the Node by building a Docker Image

The steps below describe the commands that need to be run to build the docker image and run it.
We start by cloning the latest repository from github on to your system.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/liteseed/edge
```

Next we go into the `./edge` directory and create the docker image using the dockerfile.
]
```sh
cd ./edge
docker build -t edge .
```

To persist data we create a volume.
This volume shall contain your arweave private key, the orders created on your bundler, and the storage of the data.

```sh
docker volume create liteseed
```

The next step would be to generate your arweave private key and migrate the SQLite database in your volume.

```sh
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge generate
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge migrate
```

Now you should probably get in touch with the team so we can allocate some tokens to the you.

After you get some tokens in your wallet you can check your balance

```sh
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge balance
```

At this point you can stake your tokens
```sh
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge stake -u "https://yourbundlerurl.com"
```

Now running the `balance` command will return `Staked: YES`.
```sh
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge balance
```

Finally, you can now run the bundler using and start earning both $AR and $SEED. 
```sh
docker run -v liteseed:/data edge start
```
