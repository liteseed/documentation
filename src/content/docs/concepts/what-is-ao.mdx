**AO** is a permissionless, decentralized compute platform built on Arweave. It runs across a network of distributed nodes, providing an environment where thousands of independent processes can execute in parallel.

## Core Concepts

### Actor-Oriented Model

AO adopts an actor-oriented architecture inspired by Erlang:

* **Actors**: Self-contained processes that maintain their own state and behavior.
* **Message Passing**: Actors communicate exclusively via asynchronous messages—no shared memory—ensuring isolation and fault tolerance.
* **Dynamic Scaling**: Actors can spawn new actors on demand, allowing your workloads to expand seamlessly under load.

This model eliminates memory contention and supports fine-grained concurrency, so computations scale with the network.

### Holographic State & Consensus

Unlike blockchains that reach consensus on global state, AO uses a holographic state mechanism:

1. **Immutable Log Storage**
   All actor interactions are recorded as logs on Arweave, guaranteeing permanence and auditability.
2. **Local State Reconstruction**
   Nodes reconstruct actor state from the shared log, avoiding expensive global state machine consensus.

This approach reduces on-chain processing, improves throughput, and leverages Arweave’s permanent archive as a trust layer.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g ao-cli
   ```
2. **Deploy Your First Actor**

   ```bash
   ao deploy --file myActor.js
   ```
3. **Invoke an Actor Method**

   ```bash
   ao call --actor <actor-id> --method processData --input data.json
   ```
