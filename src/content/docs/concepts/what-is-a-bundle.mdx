## What Is an Arweave Bundle? (ANS-104)

An **Arweave Bundle** is a single on-chain transaction that contains many individual **data-items**. Bundles let you group, upload, and retrieve multiple payloads in one go—saving on transaction fees and network overhead.

### 1. Data-Items Recap  
A **data-item** is the fundamental Arweave payload format. Each data-item consists of:  
- A fixed‐length header (version, owner, target, anchor)  
- A tag list (key/value metadata)  
- The binary content (your file or JSON)  
- A signature by the owner’s Arweave key  

Individually, each data-item must be posted as its own transaction. Bundling lets you batch them.

### 2. Why Bundle?  
- **Lower Fees:** One transaction fee instead of _N_ fees for _N_ items.  
- **Simpler Retrieval:** Fetch related items together.  
- **Parallel Uploads:** Clients can pipeline many data-items then bundle at once.
