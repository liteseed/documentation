Arweave is a decentralized blockchain built for permanent data storage. By paying a one-time fee, you publish your data to a network of miners that store and replicate it indefinitely. Think of it as "Bitcoin for immutable information."

## Why Permanent Storage?

Digital content can vanish over time—links break, servers retire and data disappears. Permanent storage addresses:

* **Link Rot**: URLs decay and web pages vanish, threatening academic citations, legal records, and cultural archives.
* **Data Integrity**: Immutable records ensure that once data is written, it cannot be altered or censored.
* **Long-Term Access**: Scientific datasets, legal documents, and creative works remain accessible to future generations.

## Real-World Use Cases

* **Private Archives**: Services like [ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/) let you store confidential documents and photos securely.
* **Code Preservation**: Platforms such as [Protocol.Land](https://protocol.land/) archive critical software repositories and dependency histories.
* **Cultural Heritage**: Museums and libraries can safeguard digital art, manuscripts, and historical records without risk of deletion.

## How Arweave’s Storage Model Works

Arweave uses two pricing components to ensure data remains online indefinitely:

1. **Storage Endowment**
   A conservative, long‑term estimate based on declining hardware costs funds a storage pool. That pool pays miners over time to keep data available.
2. **Immediate Miner Reward**
   A small, upfront token incentive encourages miners to add new data to their nodes quickly.

Together, these mechanisms align miner incentives with the goal of permanent, reliable storage.
