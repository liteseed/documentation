description: Understand Liteseed’s one-time, pay-once pricing for permanent Arweave storage
---

import { Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Liteseed’s pricing is built around a **one-time endowment fee** that covers storage forever—no renewals, no subscriptions, just a single payment that locks in your data on Arweave for good.

## How It Works

1. **Per-byte Pricing**  
   Liteseed calculates the exact Arweave fee required to store your payload size (in bytes).  
2. **One-Time Payment**  
   You pay the returned fee once, and your data is guaranteed to remain on-chain indefinitely.  
3. **Transparent Formula**  
   The fee is derived from Arweave’s storage endowment model, which projects hardware cost declines over decades.

<Aside title="Pricing Endpoint">
Retrieve your precise fee for any payload size:
```bash
curl https://api.liteseed.xyz/price/{bytes}
````

Response:

```json
{
  "price": "1000000000000",
  "address": "Cbj95zD…9Ek"
}
```

## Endowment-Based Fee Calculation

Arweave uses a two-part reward mechanism:

* **Storage Endowment**
  A conservative, long-term estimate (in AR) based on historical decline in hard-drive costs. This creates a fund that pays miners small amounts over time to keep your data online.
* **Immediate Reward**
  A small upfront bonus paid to miners to incentivize quick inclusion of your transaction.

Liteseed’s `/price/{bytes}` endpoint combines these into a single AR amount:

```
fee = endowment(bytes) + immediateReward(bytes)
```

> Both components factor in network parameters like current AR price, total network storage, and average miner rewards.

## Why Pay Once?

| Liteseed (One-Time)                     | Traditional Cloud (Recurring)             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Single AR payment, permanent archival   | Monthly/annual storage and retrieval fees |
| No “cold” vs. “expedited” tiers         | Variable access cost tiers                |
| Immutable, decentralized redundancy     | Centralized datacenter operations         |
| Predictable—fee never changes after pay | Costs grow with data and time             |

<Aside type="caution" title="No Hidden Fees">
Your one-time fee covers **all future** storage and replication costs. You won’t be billed again—ever.

## Cost Examples

* **1 MB file (1 048 576 bytes)**

  ```bash
  curl https://api.liteseed.xyz/price/1048576
  # → { "price": "150000000000", … }
  ```

  You’d pay **0.00015 AR** up front for permanent storage of that file.

* **1 GB archive (1 073 741 824 bytes)**

  ```bash
  curl https://api.liteseed.xyz/price/1073741824
  # → { "price": "200000000000000", … }
  ```

  You’d pay **0.2 AR** once to lock in 1 GB forever.

## Integrations

* **REST API**: `/price/{bytes}`
* **CLI**:

  ```bash
  liteseed price 1048576
  ```
* **SDK**:

  ```ts
  const { price, address } = await client.getPrice(1048576);
  ```
