import { Aside, Steps, Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution" title="4 GB File Size Limit">
  Because the API is currently in beta, uploads are capped at 4 GB per file.
</Aside>

## Overview

This Python example shows how to:

1. POST a file to Liteseed  
2. Query the Arweave storage price  
3. Pay an Arweave transaction to finalize permanent storage  
4. Download the file once it‚Äôs live on Arweave  

You‚Äôll need your Arweave wallet JWK and Python 3.8+.

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests arweave-python-client
````

> **Note:** `arweave-python-client` handles signing & submitting Arweave transactions.

<Steps>
1. **Read your file & wallet**  
2. **Upload to Liteseed**  
3. **Fetch price & pay on Arweave**  
4. **Confirm payment with Liteseed**  
</Steps>

## 2. Upload, Pay & Confirm

```python
import json
import requests
from arweave import Wallet, Transaction

API_BASE = 'https://api.liteseed.xyz'
KEY_PATH = 'arweave-key.json'
FILE_PATH = 'image.jpg'

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Load wallet and file
wallet = Wallet(KEY_PATH)
with open(FILE_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    file_bytes = f.read()

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload to Liteseed staging
resp = requests.post(
    f"{API_BASE}/data",
    files={'file': (FILE_PATH, file_bytes)},
)
resp.raise_for_status()
upload_id = resp.json()['id']
print(f"‚úîÔ∏è  Upload ID: {upload_id}")

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get price and address
size = len(file_bytes)
resp = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/price/{size}")
resp.raise_for_status()
price, address = resp.json()['price'], resp.json()['address']
print(f"Price: {price} AR  ‚Üí  {address}")

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create & send Arweave payment
tx = Transaction(wallet, target=address, quantity=str(price))
tx.sign()
tx.send()
payment_id = tx.id
print(f"‚úîÔ∏è  Payment TX ID: {payment_id}")

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm with Liteseed
resp = requests.put(f"{API_BASE}/tx/{upload_id}/{payment_id}")
resp.raise_for_status()
print("üéâ File is now permanently stored on Arweave!")
```

## 3. Download Your File

After a few blocks, fetch it via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://api.liteseed.xyz/data/<UploadID> \
  -H 'Accept: application/octet-stream' \
  -o downloaded.jpg
```
