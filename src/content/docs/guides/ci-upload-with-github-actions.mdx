title: CI Upload with GitHub Actions
description: Automatically archive your build artifacts to Liteseed on every release
---

import { Steps, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. **Configure Secrets**  
   Store your Arweave JWK as `ARWEAVE_KEY` and Liteseed API key as `LITESEED_API_KEY` in GitHub Secrets.  
2. **Checkout & Download**  
   Use `actions/checkout` and `softprops/action-gh-release` to grab your release artifact.  
3. **Upload to Liteseed**  
   `curl` posts the file to Liteseedâ€™s staging endpoint and returns an upload ID.  
4. **Pay on Arweave**  
   Fetch the AR fee, sign & send an Arweave transaction using the `arweave` CLI.  
5. **Confirm Payment**  
   `curl` PUTs the payment TX ID back to Liteseed to finalize the on-chain bundle.  
</Steps>

This GitHub Actions workflow ensures that every time you publish a new release, your build artifact is archived on Liteseedâ€”providing an immutable, permanent backup without any manual steps.
