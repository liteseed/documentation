# Introduction

The Liteseed Devnet makes it simple for you to run and test your products on the fly.
It is complete network that allows you to emulate uploading data on to Arweave using Liteseed.
This makes it great for testing out new products without spending money.

# Get started
To get started you can mint test AR token to your wallet by sending a GET request to
```
https://dev.liteseed.xyz/mint/[your-wallet-address]/1000000000000
```

> Note: Token amount is in Wei

Next any request you send typically send to `https://api.liteseed.xyz/` is supported one-to-one by the devnet.
```
https://dev.liteseed.xyz/
```

So for example this is the way you would update a function to post data.

```diff lang=js
async function postData(file, size) {
    const body = new FormData();
    body.append("file", file);
    body.append("tags[]", "image");
    body.append("tags[]", "image/jpeg");
    const response = await fetch(
-     "https://api.liteseed.xyz/data",
+     "https://dev.liteseed.xyz/data"
      {
        method: "POST",
        body,
        headers: {"content-length": size.toString(), "content-type": "application/octet-stream"}
    });
    const receipt = await response.json();
    console.log("Receipt", receipt);
    return receipt;
}
```
