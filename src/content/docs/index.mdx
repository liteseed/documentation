Liteseed Network is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) to upload data onto Arweave.

In simpler terms, the Liteseed Network is a network of bundlers. 
With Liteseed, you can upload large amounts of data onto Arweave without trusting a third-party service.

### Arweave is Permanent Data Storage

Arweave is a blockchain that unlocks permanent data storage. For a fee, you can make some data permanent, essentially a Bitcoin for data.

### Permanent Data Storage - Faster

Permanent data storage is a massive deal.
It means you can upload something and have a guarantee that your data will exist forever.
However, throughput - data uploaded per second is still a challenge.

### Bundlers

Bundlers are a solution to the throughput problem - data uploaded per second is still a challenge.
They make it possible to upload a large amount of data onto Arweave.
You get the additional benefits of cheaper uploads and faster indexing.

### Limitations

However, there exists no such thing as a free lunch. 
Using a bundler has several limitations - 
Running a bundler is not accessible
Bundlers are hard to scale
Data sent to a bundler is not private
Third-party services are centralized

## Liteseed

The goal of Liteseed is to make **permanent data accessible** while following the ethos of decentralization at its core.
We acknowledge that there are many inherent complications with building a network. 
Things like network design, privacy, and security become a concern. Both for us - the creators and the users. 

To address these problems Liteseed is built on AO. 
AO is a hyper-parallel computing platform built on top of Arweave. 
AO handles scaling and security so Liteseed can focus on network design and privacy.
