Liteseed Network is designed for developers, researchers, and enterprises that need reliable, long-term storage for critical data. 

With Liteseed you can:
- Store logs, backups, multimedia archives, and scientific datasets with a single API call
- Benefit from predictable, pay-once pricing so you never worry about renewal fees
- Rely on open standards and transparent processes; you maintain full control over your encryption keys and metadata

By handling upload orchestration, bundle creation, and payment coordination, Liteseed lets you focus on your core applications without managing complex storage workflows.

## Why Arweave?
Arweave is a decentralized blockchain designed specifically for data permanence. By paying a one-time fee, you anchor your data forever, like "Bitcoin for permanent storage."

Arweave's permaweb model ensures immutability and censorship resistance, making it ideal for preserving scientific records, legal documents, and digital art.

## How Liteseed Works

Liteseed offers a REST API for simple REST API and SDK for publishing your data to Arweave in two ways:
