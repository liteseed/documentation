Liteseed Network allows you to upload large amounts of data onto Arweave.


<a href="https://arweave.org" className="text-gray-500 no-underline" target="_blank">Arweave</a> unlocks the ability to **store data permanently**.  Permanent data storage has many applications, such as storage for humanity's most important data. 
Where Liteseed comes in is that it allows you to upload large amounts of data to Arweave at competitive prices without the need to trust a third-party service.

## What is Arweave?
Arweave is a blockchain for data storage. For a fee, you can make some data permanent. Essentially a bitcoin for data.
For more information on Arweave, check out the [Arweave documentation](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/introduction).


## Uploading Data using Liteseed
Liteseed provides a REST API for uploading data to Arweave.
You have two options for uploading data:

### 1. Upload a file

Uploading a file is simple send a `POST` Request to `/upload` endpoint.
The expected body is a `FormData` which expects a key `"file"`.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://api.liteseed.xyz/upload \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/file'
``` 
After the file is uploaded, the API will return a `id` for the file.

```json
{ "id": "1234567890" }
```

You can use this `id` to fetch the file using the `GET /data` endpoint.
And you can specify the `Mime-Type` to be the same as the original to fetch the file as the original file type.
```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://api.liteseed.xyz/data/1234567890 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -H 'Mime-Type: application/octet-stream'
``` 
Your file is immediately available for download once the API returns.
However, the file is not permanently stored on Arweave until the bundle is paid for.
Files are stored for 10 blocks of Arweave on Liteseed Networks testnet.
Once the bundle is paid for, the file is permanently stored on Arweave.
To make the file permanently available, you can pay for the file using the `POST /payment` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://api.liteseed.xyz/payment/1234567890/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"payment_id": "2322323232323232"}'
```


### 2. Upload a data item

To simplify the process of uploading data to Arweave, Liteseed provides a `Bundle` object.
A bundle is a special object that contains data and metadata about the data.
It is a special binary object that is used to upload data to Arweave.
To simplify the process of creating a bundle we recommend using the [Liteseed SDK](https://github.com/liteseed/sdk-js).
A tutorial on how to use the SDK is available [here](docs/examples/quickstart-with-sdk).
If you want are interseted in the technical details of the bundle, you can read more [here](docs/core-concepts/what-is-a-bundle).
